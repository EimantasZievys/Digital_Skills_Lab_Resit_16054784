          <p>Ever since I was a little child, I have always enjoyed playing with computers, in every sense imaginable. Not only I was obsessed with video games, but I also enjoyed tinkering with the machine itself - disassembling and reassembling the device while replacing various parts of it. Duo to the large amounts of time spent alone instead of socializing, I had become a sort of an outcast among kids my age. People would bully me because I spent time differently than them and for some reason they found it that that‘s a reasonable excuse to make someone’s life miserable. But even though they were rude to me I always fought back and earn my respect by showing them that I am not to be messed around with. I never gave up and was always nice to everyone and soon everyone around me started treating me like one of their own, despite our differences.</p>

          <p>During the beginning of my teenage years I started going to the gym and becoming really social. All of my previous „bullies“ had completely disappeared by that time and I started getting along with my townsfolk and people from my class. That was around the time I had transferred to a “Jurbarko Antano Giedraičio-Giedriaus gymnasium”. I started focusing on working out way more than before and had began making various friends, one of whom introduced me to my current girlfriend and was the one who did like 80% of work getting me and her together. I can honestly say those years I spent in that school playing games, hanging out with people and just being a generally amazing person were one of the best years of my life - I got to experience so much and I would never have traded them in for anything.</p>
 

          <p>My life got really stressful around the time it came to choose a further career path. Universities in my country are really weak so I wanted to study abroad. I always assumed my future would lean towards something involving IT, but there were too many branches for me to choose from. My mom, who is currently holding a communications degree is really amazing with understanding  and dealing with other people so she steered me towards path like hers, which led me to find the User Experience Design course in the Hague University. This course was something that met all my criteria - advancing my knowledge of various technologies while deepening my understanding of human mind and it’s patterns.</p>

          <p>The biggest fear I had while coming to Netherlands alone was that I would be too afraid to do any of my hobbies out of the fear of not having enough time for my studies or being shunned by people once again and being forced to spend all my time alone. I am sure glad that neither one of these nightmares came true, as I have plenty of time to play games with my old friends on my PC as well as hang out with my newly found friends in real life. After a while a found a wonderful job with an amazing employer who treats me with respect and dignity, something bosses from my home country should learn from. I can honestly say that the time I spent here really changed me for the best and liberated me from my preconceived notions about the world around me, which had clouded my judgement before coming to Netherlands.</p>
